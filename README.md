# explanation

UI/UX Implementation:

-   Because I prioritize the needs and preferences of the end-users. This web application is user friendly. It is easy for the users to navigate. I also used bootstrap to make this web application responsive in any device. When it comes to performance, I optimized the images for the fast UI.

Code Implementation:

-   I used Laravel 8, and html,css and bootstrap for my frontend. I break down code into functions that are reusable and maintainable. I also used cdn for bootstrap and fontawesome, and I minified my own stylesheet for fast load of the web app.
